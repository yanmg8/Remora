## Why Remora?

Remora focuses on a practical split:

- Native macOS UX for connection/session management.
- A custom terminal core for VT rendering/input performance.
- SSH + SFTP workflows in one place.

## Features

- Fantastic: Local-first SSH + SFTP workspace, ANSI/VT support for modern TUIs, xterm-style selection, quick commands/quick paths, drag-and-drop transfers.
- Beautiful: Native macOS UI with clean split layout, light/dark/system themes, and distraction-free terminal focus.
- Fast: Swift 6 native architecture with a custom terminal engine (buffer + parser + renderer), built to outperform typical Electron-based terminal apps under heavy TUI/scroll workloads.
- Secure: Local-first credential strategy with saved passwords stored only in macOS Keychain, SSH host key verification via `StrictHostKeyChecking=ask`, and explicit opt-in before any plaintext password export or copy.
- Simple: Lightweight app with a 99% Swift-native stack, keyboard-driven workflows, and practical defaults that work out of the box.

### What You Can Do Today

- Run local shell and SSH sessions with multi-tab/pane workspace.
- Manage hosts with groups, search, favorites, and quick connect.
- Use SFTP file manager for create/rename/move/delete/copy/paste/upload/download.
- Drag files onto directories or current path with visual upload target hints.
- Get immediate operation feedback via toasts and retry failed transfer tasks.
- Sync terminal directory with file manager navigation when needed.
- Configure language, appearance, shortcuts, and metrics in settings.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- macOS 14+
- Xcode 15.4+ (or Swift 6 toolchain)

### Build & Run

```bash
swift build
swift run RemoraApp
```

Optional stress tool:

```bash
swift run terminal-stress
```

## Testing

Run core test suites:

```bash
swift test
```

Run UI automation (opt-in):

```bash
REMORA_RUN_UI_TESTS=1 swift test --filter RemoraUIAutomationTests
```

If `RemoraApp` binary path is custom:

```bash
REMORA_RUN_UI_TESTS=1 REMORA_APP_BINARY=/abs/path/to/RemoraApp swift test --filter RemoraUIAutomationTests
```

## FAQ

### Q: macOS says "`Remora.app` is damaged and can't be opened". What should I do?

A: First confirm the app came from a trusted source (for example, GitHub Releases) and was fully unzipped.  
Then remove the quarantine attribute in Terminal (replace with your local path):

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/Remora.app
```

### Q: It still won't open after removing quarantine. What next?

A: Allow it once from macOS Settings:

1. Open `System Settings` -> `Privacy & Security`.
2. Find the blocked `Remora.app` notice in the Security section.
3. Click `Open Anyway` and confirm.
