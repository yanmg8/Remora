## Why Remora?

Remora focuses on a practical split:

- Native macOS UX for connection/session management.
- A custom terminal core for VT rendering/input performance.
- SSH + SFTP workflows in one place.

## Features

### Terminal & Session

- Native terminal view (`NSView`) hosted inside SwiftUI.
- ANSI/VT support for common modern TUIs:
  - SGR colors (16/256/truecolor), cursor movement, screen/line erase.
  - Alternate screen buffer (`?47/?1047/?1049`).
  - Scrolling region and reverse index.
  - UTF-8 streaming decode (cross-chunk safe), wide chars, combining chars.
  - Synchronized updates (`CSI ? 2026 h/l`).
  - Focus reporting (`?1004`), bracketed paste (`?2004`).
  - Mouse reporting (`?1000/?1002/?1003`, SGR `?1006`) with Option-forced local selection.
  - Kitty keyboard protocol (`CSI ... u`) and cursor key mode (`DECCKM`).
  - OSC 8 hyperlinks with safe `cmd+click` opening.
- Selection experience inspired by xterm-style behavior:
  - Drag selection, double-click word selection.
  - Triple-click logical line selection.
  - Option/Alt column (rectangular) selection.
  - Selection anchored to buffer space (stable across scrolling).
- Local shell and SSH session support.
- Multi-session tabs and pane-based workspace layout.
- Reconnect entry point for SSH sessions.

### SSH Host Management

- Host catalog with groups, search, templates, favorites, recent connections.
- Quick connect and quick actions from sidebar/top-level workflow.
- Host auth methods (agent/password/private key) with secure storage paths.
- Host key trust prompt flow.
- Per-host quick commands.

### SFTP / File Manager

- Local + remote file browser panel.
- Remote operations: create file/folder, rename, move, delete, copy/cut/paste, download/upload.
- Transfer queue with progress/state and retry support.
- Drag-and-drop upload:
  - Drop on directory row -> upload into that directory.
  - Drop on file row or blank list area -> upload into current directory.
  - Visual destination hint (`Drop to upload to <path>`) and drop-target highlight.
- File manager operation toasts for immediate feedback (copy/cut/delete/paste/upload/download/etc.).
- Optional terminal-directory sync with file manager navigation.
- Per-host quick paths for FTP/SFTP workflows.

### App Experience

- Simplified Chinese + English localization.
- Light/Dark/System appearance support.
- Customizable app keyboard shortcuts (with conflict detection).
- Settings UI for language, appearance, file manager path, metrics sampling, and shortcuts.
- Built-in project/about links and issue entry points.
- Server metrics/status panel for connected SSH hosts.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- macOS 14+
- Xcode 15.4+ (or Swift 6 toolchain)

### Build & Run

```bash
swift build
swift run RemoraApp
```

Optional stress tool:

```bash
swift run terminal-stress
```

## Testing

Run core test suites:

```bash
swift test
```

Run UI automation (opt-in):

```bash
REMORA_RUN_UI_TESTS=1 swift test --filter RemoraUIAutomationTests
```

If `RemoraApp` binary path is custom:

```bash
REMORA_RUN_UI_TESTS=1 REMORA_APP_BINARY=/abs/path/to/RemoraApp swift test --filter RemoraUIAutomationTests
```

## Project Structure

- `Sources/RemoraCore`: SSH/SFTP/session/host/security/core models.
- `Sources/RemoraTerminal`: parser, buffer, renderer, terminal input/view.
- `Sources/RemoraApp`: SwiftUI app, workspace UI, settings, file manager.
- `Sources/TerminalStressTool`: terminal throughput/stress utility.
- `Tests/*`: core, terminal, and app tests.
- `docs/`: design/tasks/checklists and operational notes.

## Roadmap

Current focus:

- More integration coverage for real-host flows.
- Performance guardrails and regressions.
- Pre-open-source hardening (security, docs, release process).
