## Why Remora?

Remora focuses on a practical split:

- Native macOS UX for connection/session management.
- SSH + SFTP workflows in one place.
- An AI assistant that fits into terminal work naturally for explanation, command suggestions, and troubleshooting instead of forcing a chat-first workflow.
- A lightweight, mostly Swift-native architecture that keeps the app fast, direct, and easy to reason about.

## Features

- Fantastic: Local-first SSH + SFTP workspace, ANSI/VT support for modern TUIs, xterm-style selection, quick commands/quick paths, drag-and-drop transfers.
- Beautiful: Native macOS UI with clean split layout, light/dark/system themes, and distraction-free terminal focus.
- AI-assisted: Built-in Terminal AI with provider → model configuration, custom endpoints, OpenAI / Claude compatible APIs, queued prompts, context compression, and command explanation/suggestion flows.
- Fast: Swift 6 native architecture with a SwiftTerm-backed terminal stack and native macOS UI, tuned for practical TUI and scroll-heavy workflows.
- Secure: Local-first credential strategy with saved passwords stored only in macOS Keychain, SSH host key verification via `StrictHostKeyChecking=ask`, and explicit opt-in before any plaintext password export or copy.
- Simple: Lightweight app with a 99% Swift-native stack, keyboard-driven workflows, and practical defaults that work out of the box.

### What You Can Do Today

- Run local shell and SSH sessions with multi-tab/pane workspace.
- Manage hosts with groups, search, favorites, and quick connect.
- Use SFTP file manager for create/rename/move/delete/copy/paste/upload/download.
- Drag files onto directories or current path with visual upload target hints.
- Get immediate operation feedback via toasts and retry failed transfer tasks.
- Sync terminal directory with file manager navigation when needed.
- Use Terminal AI from the side drawer to explain output, suggest the next command, repair common errors, and compress long conversations automatically.
- Configure language, appearance, shortcuts, and metrics in settings.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- macOS 14+
- Xcode 15.4+

### Run from Source

```bash
swift build
swift run RemoraApp
```

If you prefer Xcode, open `Remora.xcodeproj`, let Xcode resolve Swift packages on first launch, and run the `Remora` scheme.

### Package Locally

Local packaging and GitHub Actions use the same command:

```bash
./scripts/package_macos.sh --arch "$(uname -m)" --version 0.0.0-local --build-number 1
```

The packaged app is written to `dist/`, for example:

```bash
dist/Remora-0.0.0-local-macos-arm64.zip
```

Optional stress tool:

```bash
swift run terminal-stress
```

## Testing

Run core test suites:

```bash
swift test
```

Run UI automation (opt-in):

```bash
REMORA_RUN_UI_TESTS=1 swift test --filter RemoraUIAutomationTests
```

If `RemoraApp` binary path is custom:

```bash
REMORA_RUN_UI_TESTS=1 REMORA_APP_BINARY=/abs/path/to/RemoraApp swift test --filter RemoraUIAutomationTests
```

## FAQ

### Q: macOS says "`Remora.app` is damaged and can't be opened". What should I do?

A: First confirm the app came from a trusted source (for example, GitHub Releases) and was fully unzipped.  
Then remove the quarantine attribute in Terminal (replace with your local path):

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/Remora.app
```

### Q: It still won't open after removing quarantine. What next?

A: Allow it once from macOS Settings:

1. Open `System Settings` -> `Privacy & Security`.
2. Find the blocked `Remora.app` notice in the Security section.
3. Click `Open Anyway` and confirm.
